what is an advantage to using a text editor? 
    Text editors allow for for you to understand what is going on with
    the code that we are producing. The preview allows for information
    to be convayed correctly and if not than changed. It also allows for 
    removal of complexity and speeding the coding process up. 

Is there an advantage of using a relative vs an absolute URL?
    Absolute URLs allow for more information to be shared versus relative
    thus impacting the ease of directing where the user would need to be
    taken. Realtives are often shorter due to the nature of keeping 
    the url compact therefore may produce some positives for simplicity.
